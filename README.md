# 🚦 Indian Traffic Annotator

A mini computer vision project focused on Indian traffic dataset preparation and annotation. This project uses LabelImg for image annotation and OpenCV to visualize bounding boxes. Built to align with real-world AI use cases like smart traffic analysis, particularly for Indian road conditions.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- 🏷️ **LabelImg** – to annotate vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, etc.
- 🧠 **Python + OpenCV** – to visualize and validate the annotations
- 🎨 **HTML + CSS** – clean front-end to showcase project as a UI/UX designer
- 📁 **Pascal VOC (.xml)** – format used for annotations

## 🖼️ Sample Annotated Image

## 🧪 How to Run

### 1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # or source venv/bin/activate (Mac/Linux)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Visualize the annotations:
cd backend
python visualizer.py

### ✨ Purpose

This project was built as part of my submission for the IISc Bangalore AI Research Internship 2025, with a goal to demonstrate image annotation precision, attention to detail, and real-world problem alignment with Indian traffic mobility datasets.
